    "If you are familiar with http://stats.nba.com/, some stats pages will directly tell you how the data can be retrieved. For example, the data needed for [Tracking Shots Dashboard](http://stats.nba.com/player/201935/shots-dash/) comes from [this URL](http://stats.nba.com/stats/playerdashptshots?DateFrom=&DateTo=&GameSegment=&LastNGames=0&LeagueID=00&Location=&Month=0&OpponentTeamID=0&Outcome=&PerMode=PerGame&Period=0&PlayerID=201935&Season=2017-18&SeasonSegment=&SeasonType=Playoffs&TeamID=0&VsConference=&VsDivision=). This link can be found under Tools > Developer tools menu (Control-Shift-I) if you are using [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/). Once you open Developer tools, you need to reload the page (for F5). Then, go to `Networks` menu under Developer tools pane. Type into the `Filter` text input box, type `stats/`. This will find (if any) GET URL links that we can use. The URL corresponding to the [Tracking Shots Dashboard](http://stats.nba.com/player/201935/shots-dash/) is [here](http://stats.nba.com/stats/playerdashptshots?DateFrom=&DateTo=&GameSegment=&LastNGames=0&LeagueID=00&Location=&Month=0&OpponentTeamID=0&Outcome=&PerMode=PerGame&Period=0&PlayerID=201935&Season=2017-18&SeasonSegment=&SeasonType=Playoffs&TeamID=0&VsConference=&VsDivision=). If you are feeling adventurous, you can use another data to create your dashboard with.\n",

If you would like to pursue a completely different data source, you are encouraged to. Keep in mind you want to create some dashboard to automatically update information. I can help you to determine wheter a site can be reverse engineered relatively easily if you choose to pursue this option.\n",
